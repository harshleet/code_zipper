![CodeSnipper Logo](https://example.com/codesnipper_logo.png)

CodeSnipper is an application designed to help developers securely store coding notes. It provides authentication and authorization functionalities using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure that only authorized users can access and manage their saved code snippets. With user-friendly features like code block creation with a copy button, React Markdown support, and a convenient search bar, CodeSnipper aims to enhance the coding experience and streamline the organization of code snippets.

## Features

### Authentication and Authorization

CodeSnipper implements JWT-based authentication and authorization to ensure that only registered and logged-in users can access the app's functionalities. This adds an extra layer of security to protect sensitive coding notes.

### Code Block Creation with Copy Button

When adding a code snippet, CodeSnipper allows users to create a code block that includes a convenient "Copy to Clipboard" button. This feature enables users to quickly copy code snippets to their clipboard and use them in their projects without the hassle of manual copying.

### React Markdown Support

CodeSnipper supports rendering code snippets using React Markdown. Users can format their notes with Markdown syntax to create clear and readable code blocks, add comments, and organize their code snippets efficiently.

### Search Bar

To facilitate easy access to saved coding notes, CodeSnipper offers a search bar. Users can quickly search for specific code snippets by keywords, tags, or any relevant text, making it effortless to find the information they need.
